Constraints: Use only arrays, linkedlists, and stacks provided by the default java library

Plan:

Create flight objects that contain a source city, destination city, travel time, and travel cost.

Create a flight map object that contains a linked list of linked lists of flight objects wherein the outer list
represents a source city and the inner list represents all flight objects that share the same source city.

Add a method to the flight map that adds flights to the linked list of linked lists based on source city.

Add a method to the flight map that uses a stack and Dijkstra's algorithm to find shortest past based on either distance or time.

Use Scanner to get file input using Split method to separate into string objects.
